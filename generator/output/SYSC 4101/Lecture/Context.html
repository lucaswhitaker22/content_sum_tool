            <h1>SYSC 4101 / SYSC 5105: Software Verification, Validation, and Testing</h1>
<h2>Context</h2>
<h3>Validation, Verification, and Testing</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Validation</strong>: The process of evaluating a system or component to determine whether it satisfies the specified requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Verification</strong>: The process of evaluating a system or component to determine whether the products of a given development phase satisfy the conditions imposed at the start of that phase.</li>
<li><strong>Testing</strong>: A dynamic verification technique involving the execution of the system with specific inputs to observe its behavior.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why Do We Test?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Goal of Testing</strong>:</li>
<li>To demonstrate that the software can be depended upon, i.e., to ensure sufficient dependability.</li>
<li>To show the presence of bugs, though it cannot prove their absence [E.W. Dijkstra, Turing Award Lecture, 1972].</li>
<li>Testing is integrated with other verification activities to enhance software reliability.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Definitions (Verification vs. Validation)</h2>
<h3>IEEE Definitions (Std 610.12.1990)</h3>
<h4>Software Verification</h4>
<ul>
<li>The process of evaluating a system or component to determine whether the products of a given development phase satisfy the conditions imposed at the start of that phase.</li>

</ul>
<h4>Software Validation</h4>
<ul>
<li>The process of evaluating a system or component during or at the end of the development process to determine whether it satisfies specified requirements.</li>

<h2>Definitions (V&amp;V Techniques)</h2>
<h3>Dynamic Techniques</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Verification Testing (or simply, Testing)</strong>:</li>
<li>Inputs supplied to the system are valued (values instead of symbols).</li>
<li>The most used V&amp;V technique.</li>
<li><strong>Symbolic Execution</strong>:</li>
<li>Inputs supplied to the system are symbolic (symbols, not values).</li>
<li>Visualizing what is accomplished by a sequence of assignment statements.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Example of Symbolic Execution</h4>
<p><code>c
void foo(int x, int y) {
    int t;
    if(x &gt; y)
        t = x + 1;
    else
        t = y;
    if(t &lt;= x)
        // do something
}</code></p>
<p>Replace <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>t</code> with symbols <code>α</code>, <code>β</code>, <code>γ</code> respectively:
- After line 6:
  - <code>α &gt; β =&gt; γ = α + 1</code>
  - <code>α ≤ β =&gt; γ = β</code>
- Line 8 executes if:
  - <code>α &gt; β =&gt; γ = α + 1 ∧ γ ≤ α</code> (not satisfiable)
  - <code>α ≤ β =&gt; γ = β ∧ γ ≤ α</code> (satisfiable: <code>α = β</code>)</p>
<h3>Static Techniques</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Program Slicing</strong>:</li>
<li>Given a variable and its location in the control flow of the program, build an executable subprogram by identifying and discarding irrelevant statements.</li>
<li>Example: Slice on the value of <code>z</code> at statement 12 in a given program.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>pascal
begin
    read(x, y);
    if x &lt;= 1 then
        sum := y;
    else begin
        read(z);
        total := x * y;
    end;
    write(total, sum);
end;</code></p>
<p>Slice on the value of <code>z</code> at statement 12:
<code>pascal
begin
    read(x, y);
    if x &lt;= 1 then
        // do nothing
    else begin
        read(z);
    end;
end;</code></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Model Checking</strong>:</li>
<li>Verifying properties of the system using models (e.g., finite state machines, Petri nets).</li>
<li>Exhaustively and automatically check whether a model meets a given specification.</li>
<li>Examples: Verify that a state is always reachable or never reachable, verify there is no deadlock.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Example of Model Checking</h4>
<ul>
<li>The alternating-bit protocol designed to transmit information reliably over noisy telephone lines.</li>
<li>Model from 1969 paper by Bartlett, K.A., Scantlebury, R.A., and Wilkinson, P.T.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Abstract Interpretation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Making a sound approximation of the semantics of a program.</li>
<li>Identifying that all execution traces of the program are within bounds.</li>
<li>If a property is true on the approximation, it is true for the program.</li>
<li>Tool support scales up: e.g., 1,000,000 lines of C (Airbus).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Inspection</h3>
<ul>
<li>Techniques aimed at systematically verifying software artifacts to find as many defects as possible, as early as possible.</li>
<li>Performed by a group of team workers.</li>
<li>Works on source code but not only: any software artifact (e.g., requirements, diagrams, tests).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fault Handling and Testing</h2>
<h3>Fault Handling</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fault Tolerance</strong>: Ensuring the system continues to operate correctly even when faults occur.</li>
<li><strong>Fault Detection</strong>: Identifying faults in the system.</li>
<li><strong>Debugging</strong>: Locating and fixing faults.</li>
<li><strong>Testing</strong>: Part of fault detection and debugging.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cost of Testing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Testing represents a substantial percentage of software development costs and time to market.</li>
<li>Restricting early testing usually increases costs.</li>
<li>Industry ratio Test-LOC / App-LOC can be 2, 3, 4; open source ratio App-LOC / Test-LOC can be 2, 3, … 7.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Software Bugs and Their Impact</h2>
<h3>Economic Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) study:</li>
<li>Estimated annual cost due to inadequate software testing: $5.85 billion.</li>
<li>Projected cost to the entire U.S. economy: $59.5 billion.</li>
<li>Consortium for Information and Software Quality:</li>
<li>Poor software quality in the USA = $2 trillions in 2020.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Anecdotal Evidence</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bug in telecom: 8-digit dollar cost in compensation.</li>
<li>Debugging Fault: $100,000 for one!</li>
<li>Examples of costly bugs:</li>
<li>A 104 years old woman received an invitation to a kindergarten (1992).</li>
<li>Underground train in London left a station without the driver (1990).</li>
<li>Failure in an automated luggage system in an airport (1995).</li>
