            <h1>SYSC 4101 / SYSC 5105: Software Verification &amp; Validation</h1>
<h2>Context</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Validation? Verification? Testing?</strong> These terms are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct meanings in software engineering.</li>
<li><strong>Why do we test?</strong> Testing is crucial to ensure the quality and reliability of software. It helps identify defects, improve performance, and ensure the software meets user needs.</li>
<li><strong>What should we do during testing?</strong> Testing involves a systematic process of executing software to identify defects and ensure it meets specified requirements.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Definitions (Verification vs. Validation)</h2>
<h3>Software Verification</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>IEEE definition (Std 610.12.1990):</strong> The process of evaluating a system or component to determine whether the products of a given development phase satisfy the conditions imposed at the start of that phase.</li>
<li><strong>In simpler terms:</strong> Checking if the software adheres to its internal specifications and design principles.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> Ensuring that the code follows coding standards and adheres to the design documentation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Software Validation</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>IEEE definition (Std 610.12.1990):</strong> The process of evaluating a system or component during or at the end of the development process to determine whether it satisfies specified requirements.</li>
<li><strong>In simpler terms:</strong> Checking if the software meets the user's needs and expectations.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> Evaluating the software's usability, performance, and functionality against the user requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Verification focuses on internal consistency and correctness, while validation focuses on meeting user needs and intended use.</p>
<h2>Verification vs. Validation: A Table Summary</h2>
<p>| Aspect | Verification | Validation |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | Ensure the product is built correctly | Ensure the right product is built |
| Focus | Internal consistency, correctness, compliance | Meeting user needs and intended use |
| Testing Type | Static Testing | Dynamic Testing |
| Methods | Reviews, inspections, walkthroughs, static analysis | Unit testing, integration testing, system testing, user acceptance testing (UAT) |
| Code Execution | Does not involve executing the code | Involves running the code |
| Goal | Ensure the system matches design specifications | Ensure the system performs as expected by users |
| Examples | Code reviews, requirement reviews, design analysis | Code reviews, requirement reviews, design analysis |</p>
<h2>Definitions (V&amp;V Techniques)</h2>
<h3>Dynamic Techniques</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Verification Testing (or simply, Testing):</strong> Involves executing the software with actual values as inputs to observe its behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Symbolic execution:</strong> A technique that uses symbolic values instead of concrete values to analyze the program's behavior. This allows for a more comprehensive analysis of all possible execution paths.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Dynamic techniques involve executing the code to observe its behavior, while static techniques analyze the code without execution.</p>
<h3>Static Techniques</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Program slicing:</strong> A technique that extracts a portion of the code related to a specific variable or computation. This helps isolate and analyze specific parts of the code.</li>
<li><strong>Model Checking:</strong> A technique that uses formal models (e.g., finite state machines, Petri nets) to verify properties of the system. It exhaustively checks if the model meets a given specification.</li>
<li><strong>Abstract interpretation:</strong> A technique that uses abstract values to approximate the behavior of the program. This allows for efficient analysis of large and complex programs.</li>
<li><strong>Inspection:</strong> A manual technique that involves a group of team members reviewing software artifacts (e.g., code, requirements, design documents) to identify defects.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Static techniques are valuable for early defect detection and can be used to analyze code without execution.</p>
<h2>Symbolic Execution</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inputs:</strong> Symbolic values (symbols, not concrete values) are used as inputs to the program.</li>
<li><strong>Visualizing:</strong> Symbolic execution helps visualize the program's behavior by tracking the transformations of symbolic values through the code.</li>
<li><strong>Input/Output Function:</strong> Symbolic execution computes an input/output function, which represents the relationship between the input values and the output values of the program.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Consider a simple program that reads two values (x and y) and calculates their sum (z). Symbolic execution would represent x and y as symbols (α and β) and track the transformation of these symbols through the code.</p>
<h2>Symbolic Execution (cont.)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Replacing Variables:</strong> Replace variables (x, y, t) with symbolic representations (α, β, γ).</li>
<li><strong>Path Conditions:</strong> Symbolic execution identifies path conditions, which are logical expressions that determine which execution paths are possible based on the values of the symbolic variables.</li>
<li><strong>Satisfiability:</strong> The path conditions are checked for satisfiability, meaning whether there exist values for the symbolic variables that make the conditions true.</li>
<li><strong>Code Behavior:</strong> By analyzing the path conditions and their satisfiability, we can understand the behavior of the code and identify potential defects.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Symbolic execution is a powerful technique for analyzing the behavior of code and identifying potential defects.</p>
<h2>Program Slicing</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Goal:</strong> Given a variable and its location in the code, program slicing aims to extract a portion of the code that influences the value of that variable.</li>
<li><strong>Process:</strong> It involves identifying and discarding statements that are irrelevant to the computation of the variable's value.</li>
<li><strong>Tool Support:</strong> Program slicing is a common compiler task, and there are many tools available to perform this analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Consider a program that calculates the sum of two numbers (x and y). Program slicing can be used to extract the code that influences the value of the sum variable.</p>
<h2>Model Checking</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Model checking verifies properties of the system using formal models (e.g., finite state machines, Petri nets).</li>
<li><strong>Method:</strong> It exhaustively and automatically checks whether the model meets a given specification.</li>
<li><strong>Applications:</strong> Model checking is used to verify properties such as:<ul>
<li><strong>Reachability:</strong> Whether a particular state is reachable in the system.</li>
<li><strong>Deadlock:</strong> Whether the system can reach a state where no progress is possible.</li>
<li><strong>Termination:</strong> Whether the program will eventually terminate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> The alternating-bit protocol is a classic example of a system that can be analyzed using model checking. Model checking can be used to verify that the protocol ensures reliable communication even in the presence of errors.</p>
<h2>Aside Note - Petri Nets</h2>
<p>Petri nets are a graphical modeling language used to represent and analyze concurrent systems. They consist of places (representing states) and transitions (representing events). Tokens are used to represent the current state of the system.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A Petri net can be used to model the mutual exclusion problem, where multiple processes need to access a shared resource. The Petri net can be used to verify that the system ensures that only one process can access the resource at a time.</p>
<h2>Model Checking (cont.)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Alternating-Bit Protocol:</strong> This protocol was designed to ensure reliable communication over noisy telephone lines.</li>
<li><strong>Model Checking Application:</strong> Model checking can be used to verify that the alternating-bit protocol ensures reliable communication even in the presence of errors.</li>
<li><strong>Tool Support:</strong> Model checkers such as SPIN (with the Promela language) can be used to perform model checking.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Model checking is a powerful technique for verifying the correctness of concurrent systems.</p>
<h2>Abstract Interpretation</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sound Approximation:</strong> Abstract interpretation aims to make a sound approximation of the program's semantics.</li>
<li><strong>Execution Traces:</strong> It identifies that all execution traces of the program are within certain bounds.</li>
<li><strong>Property Verification:</strong> If a property is true on the approximation, it is also true for the original program.</li>
<li><strong>Tool Support:</strong> Abstract interpretation tools are available for various programming languages, including C, C++, Java, and Ada.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Abstract interpretation is a valuable technique for analyzing large and complex programs and verifying properties that are difficult to check directly.</p>
<h2>Inspection</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Systematic Verification:</strong> Inspection techniques aim to systematically verify software artifacts to identify defects.</li>
<li><strong>Team Collaboration:</strong> Inspections are typically performed by a group of team members.</li>
<li><strong>Defect Identification:</strong> Faults often become more obvious to team members other than the original author.</li>
<li><strong>Artifact Scope:</strong> Inspections can be applied to any software artifact, including code, requirements, design documents, and test cases.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Inspections are a valuable technique for early defect detection and can be used to improve the quality of software artifacts.</p>
<h2>So... We Are Interested in Faults</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fault Handling:</strong> Fault handling encompasses various approaches to managing faults in software.</li>
<li><strong>Fault Avoidance:</strong> Aims to prevent faults from occurring in the first place.</li>
<li><strong>Fault Detection:</strong> Focuses on identifying faults during development and testing.</li>
<li><strong>Fault Tolerance:</strong> Enables the system to continue operating even in the presence of faults.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Understanding the different aspects of fault handling is crucial for developing reliable and robust software.</p>
<h2>Goal of Testing</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dijkstra's Quote:</strong> "Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence."</li>
<li><strong>Finite Nature:</strong> Testing is necessarily finite, so it cannot guarantee the absence of all bugs.</li>
<li><strong>Integration with V&amp;V:</strong> Testing should be integrated with other verification and validation activities.</li>
<li><strong>Dependability:</strong> The main goal of testing is to demonstrate that the software can be depended upon.</li>
<li><strong>Context Dependence:</strong> The level of "sufficient" dependability depends on the context of the software.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Testing is a crucial part of software development, but it cannot guarantee the absence of all bugs.</p>
<h2>Remarks</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Faulty Software:</strong> No matter how rigorous we are, software is likely to have faults.</li>
<li><strong>Testing Costs:</strong> Testing represents a significant portion of software development costs and time to market.</li>
<li><strong>Incomplete Testing:</strong> It is impossible to test under all operating conditions, so we need to gain confidence that the system behaves as expected based on incomplete testing.</li>
<li><strong>Complex Systems:</strong> Testing large systems is complex and requires strategic planning and technological tools.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Testing is a challenging but essential aspect of software development.</p>
<h2>Cost of Testing</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Budget Allocation:</strong> Approximately half of the development budget is typically spent on testing.</li>
<li><strong>Post-Design Activity:</strong> Testing is a major post-design activity in real-world software development.</li>
<li><strong>Early Testing Benefits:</strong> Restricting early testing can lead to increased costs later in the development cycle.</li>
<li><strong>Test Code Ratio:</strong> In some organizations, the amount of test code can exceed the amount of application code.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Testing is a significant investment, but it is essential for ensuring the quality and reliability of software.</p>
<h2>Software Bugs - Cost</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic Impact:</strong> Inadequate software testing has a significant economic impact, as evidenced by studies conducted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).</li>
<li><strong>Anecdotal Evidence:</strong> Numerous anecdotal examples illustrate the high cost of software bugs, including incidents in telecommunications and other industries.</li>
<li><strong>Consortium for Information and Software Quality:</strong> This consortium estimates that poor software quality in the USA costs trillions of dollars annually.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Software bugs can have significant financial and societal consequences, highlighting the importance of effective testing.</p>
<h2>Software Bugs...</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Year-Related Bug:</strong> A 104-year-old woman received an invitation to a kindergarten.</li>
<li><strong>Interface Misuse:</strong> An underground train left a station without a driver.</li>
<li><strong>Over-Budget Project:</strong> An automated luggage system in an airport failed.</li>
<li><strong>NASA Mission to Mars:</strong> Incorrect conversion from imperial to metric units led to the loss of a Mars satellite.</li>
<li><strong>Ariane 5 Flight 501:</strong> The space rocket was destroyed due to a software bug.</li>
<li><strong>Therac-25:</strong> A radiation therapy machine killed several patients due to software errors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> These examples demonstrate the real-world impact of software bugs and the importance of rigorous testing to prevent such incidents.</p>
