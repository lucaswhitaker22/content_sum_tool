            <h2>SYSC 4101 / SYSC 5105: Definitions and Concepts in Software Testing</h2>
<h3>Definitions—Part I</h3>
<h4>Key Concepts</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fault</strong>: A defect in a system, often referred to as a bug. Faults are committed by humans and can be exemplified by a faulty statement.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: A typo in the code that leads to incorrect behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Error</strong>: Errors occur at runtime when some part of the system enters an unexpected state due to the activation of a fault.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: An erroneous state where a variable holds an unexpected value.</li>
<li><strong>Failure</strong>: A failure of the system occurs when the delivered service deviates from what the system is intended for.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: The system crashes or produces incorrect output.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> The terms "fault," "error," and "failure" are distinct and important in software testing.</p>
<h3>Fault → Error → Failure</h3>
<h4>Conditions Necessary for Failure</h4>
<p>For a failure to be observed, three conditions must be met:
- <strong>Reachability</strong>: The location(s) in the program that contain the fault must be reached.
  - <strong>Example</strong>: The faulty line of code must be executed.
- <strong>Infection</strong>: The state of the program must be incorrect due to the fault.
  - <strong>Example</strong>: The faulty code must alter the program's state in an unexpected way.
- <strong>Propagation</strong>: The infected state must propagate to cause some output of the program to be observed as incorrect.
  - <strong>Example</strong>: The incorrect state must affect the output or behavior of the program in a noticeable way.</p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> All three conditions (reachability, infection, and propagation) are necessary for a failure to be observed.</p>
<h3>Observability vs. Controllability</h3>
<h4>Software Observability</h4>
<ul>
<li>Observability refers to how easy it is to observe the behavior of a program in terms of its outputs, effects on the environment, and other hardware and software components.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Software that interacts with hardware devices, databases, or remote files may have low observability.</li>
<li>Observability relates to propagation, as it affects how easily the incorrect output can be observed.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Software Controllability</h4>
<ul>
<li>Controllability refers to how easy it is to provide a program with the needed inputs, in terms of values, operations, and behaviors.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Software with inputs from keyboards is easier to control than software with inputs from hardware sensors or distributed software.</li>
<li>Controllability relates to reachability and infection, as it affects how easily the faulty code can be executed and the state can be made incorrect.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Both observability and controllability are crucial for effective software testing.</p>
<h3>Test Scaffolding / Test Harness</h3>
<h4>Components of Test Scaffolding</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Test Driver</strong>:</li>
<li>A software component or test tool that replaces a component that takes care of the control and/or the calling of a software component.</li>
<li>Executes a test case or a test suite/set.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: A driver that calls a function under test with specific input values.</li>
<li><strong>Test Stub (Mock)</strong>:</li>
<li>A skeletal or special-purpose implementation of a software module, used to develop or test a component that calls the stub or otherwise depends on it.</li>
<li>Replaces a called component.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Simulating a piece of code not yet ready.</li>
<li><strong>Oracle</strong>:</li>
<li>Assists in deciding whether a test outcome is successful or not.</li>
<li>Compares the actual output against the expected output.</li>
<li>Decides what the expected output is, given the test inputs of a test case.<ul>
<li>Often done by software for comparison and by humans for determining expected outputs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Putting Things Together</h3>
<h4>Program Under Test (PUT) and Test Infrastructure</h4>
<p><code>markdown
Program Under Test
  Can be a function/method, a class, a package/sub-system, an entire software.
Driver
  executes
  Test inputs
  Outputs
  produces
  creates / interacts with
Stub(s)
  uses
  produces
Oracle
  Compares expected outputs (either computed or provided) and actual outputs.
  Verdict (pass/fail)
  Oracle uses inputs to determine expected outputs
  Oracle collects actual outputs</code></p>
<h4>A Simple Example</h4>
<p>```c
// File mySquareRoot.h
double mySquareRoot(double num);</p>
<p>// File stubForMySquareRoot.h
void setReturnValue(double r);</p>
<p>// File mySquareRoot-Stub.c</p>
<h1>include "mySquareRoot.h"</h1>
<h1>include "stubForMySquareRoot.h"</h1>
<p>static double valueToReturn;</p>
<p>double mySquareRoot(double n) {
    return valueToReturn;
}</p>
<p>void setReturnValue(double r) {
    valueToReturn = r;
}</p>
<p>// File root.c
int root(double a, double b, double c, double <em>root1, double </em>root2) {
    double determinant = b<em>b - 4</em>a<em>c;
    if (determinant &gt; 0) {
        </em>root1 = (-b + mySquareRoot(determinant))/(2<em>a);
        </em>root2 = (-b - mySquareRoot(determinant))/(2<em>a);
        return 1;
    } else if (determinant == 0) {
        </em>root1 = <em>root2 = -b/(2</em>a);
        return 1;
    } else {
        return 0;
    }
}</p>
<p>// File main.c (Driver)</p>
<h1>include "root.h"</h1>
<h1>include "stubForMySquareRoot.h"</h1>
<p>int main() {
    double a, b, c, root1, root2;
    int result;
    double expectedRoot1, expectedRoot2;
    double epsilon = 0.000001;</p>
<pre><code>// Test case 1
setReturnValue(5); // Instructing the stub what to respond to root()
a = -2; b = 1; c = 3;
expectedRoot1 = -1; expectedRoot2 = 1.5;
result = root(a, b, c, &amp;root1, &amp;root2);

if ((result==1) &amp;&amp; (fabs(expectedRoot1-root1)&lt;epsilon) &amp;&amp; (fabs(expectedRoot2-root2)&lt;epsilon))
    printf("test case 1 passes.\n");
else
    printf("test case 1 fails.\n");

return 0;
</code></pre>
<p>}
```</p>
<h3>Automated Test Infrastructure</h3>
<h4>Examples of Automated Testing Frameworks</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>JUnit (Java)</strong>
  <code>java
  public void evaluatesExpression()  {
      Calculator calculator = new Calculator(); 
      int sum = calculator.evaluate("1+2+3");
      assertEquals(6, sum); 
  }</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Google’s C++ xUnit</strong>
  <code>cpp
  TEST(CalculatorTest, sumOneTwoThree) {
      Calculator calculator;
      int sum = calculator.evaluate("1+2+3");
      EXPECT_EQ(6, sum); 
  }</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>TTCN-3 (Testing and Test Control Notation)</strong>
  <code>ttcn3
  template calculatorRequest request1 := {
      input := “1+2+3” 
  }
  template calculatorResponse response1 := {
      output := 6 
  }
  testcase test1() runs on MTCType {
      calculator.send(request1);
      alt {
          [] calculator.receive(response1) {
              setverdict(pass)
          }
          [] calculator.receive {
              setverdict(fail)
          }
      }
  }</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Different testing frameworks have similar concepts but vary in syntax and implementation details.</p>
