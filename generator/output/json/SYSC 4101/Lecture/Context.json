Dijkstra, Turing Award Lecture, 1972].\n  - Testing is integrated with other verification activities to enhance software reliability.\n\n## Definitions (Verification vs. Validation)\n\n### IEEE Definitions (Std 610.12.1990)\n\n#### Software Verification\n- The process of evaluating a system or component to determine whether the products of a given development phase satisfy the conditions imposed at the start of that phase.\n- Checking whether the system adheres to properties termed as verification properties.\n- Ensuring the system is constructed well.\n\n#### Software Validation\n- The process of evaluating a system or component during or at the end of the development process to determine whether it satisfies specified requirements.\n- Ensuring the right system is built.\n- Relationship with other software engineering activities (e.g., Requirements elicitation, Analysis).\n\n## Verification vs Validation\n\n### Aspect Comparison\n\n| Aspect          | Verification                                                                 | Validation                                                                 |\n|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Purpose**     | Ensure the product is built correctly                                       | Ensure the right product is built                                          |\n| **Focus**      | Internal consistency, correctness, compliance                              | Meeting user needs and intended use                                      |\n| **Testing Type**| Static Testing                                                             | Dynamic Testing                                                           |\n| **Methods**     | Reviews, inspections, walkthroughs, static analysis                       | Unit testing, integration testing, system testing, user acceptance testing (UAT) |\n| **Code Execution**| Does not involve executing the code                                     | Involves running the code                                                  |\n| **Goal**        | Ensure the system matches design specifications                            | Ensure the system performs as expected by users                          |\n| **Examples**    | Code reviews, requirement reviews, design analysis                          | Code reviews, requirement reviews, design analysis                        |\n\n## Definitions (V&V Techniques)\n\n### Dynamic Techniques\n\n- **Verification Testing (or simply, Testing)**:\n  - Inputs supplied to the system are valued (values instead of symbols).\n  - The most used V&V technique.\n- **Symbolic Execution**:\n  - Inputs supplied to the system are symbolic (symbols, not values).\n  - Visualizing what is accomplished by a sequence of assignment statements.\n\n#### Example of Symbolic Execution\n\n```c\nvoid foo(int x, int y) {\n    int t;\n    if(x > y)\n        t = x + 1;\n    else\n        t = y;\n    if(t <= x)\n        // do something\n}\n```\n\nReplace `x`, `y`, `t` with symbols `α`, `β`, `γ` respectively:\n- After line 6:\n  - `α > β => γ = α + 1`\n  - `α ≤ β => γ = β`\n- Line 8 executes if:\n  - `α > β => γ = α + 1 ∧ γ ≤ α` (not satisfiable)\n  - `α ≤ β => γ = β ∧ γ ≤ α` (satisfiable: `α = β`)\n\n### Static Techniques\n\n- **Program Slicing**:\n  - Given a variable and its location in the control flow of the program, build an executable subprogram by identifying and discarding irrelevant statements.\n  - Example: Slice on the value of `z` at statement 12 in a given program.\n\n```pascal\nbegin\n    read(x, y);\n    if x <= 1 then\n        sum := y;\n    else begin\n        read(z);\n        total := x * y;\n    end;\n    write(total, sum);\nend;\n```\n\nSlice on the value of `z` at statement 12:\n```pascal\nbegin\n    read(x, y);\n    if x <= 1 then\n        // do nothing\n    else begin\n        read(z);\n    end;\nend;\n```\n\n- **Model Checking**:\n  - Verifying properties of the system using models (e.g., finite state machines, Petri nets).\n  - Exhaustively and automatically check whether a model meets a given specification.\n  - Examples: Verify that a state is always reachable or never reachable, verify there is no deadlock.\n\n#### Example of Model Checking\n\n- The alternating-bit protocol designed to transmit information reliably over noisy telephone lines.\n- Model from 1969 paper by Bartlett, K.A., Scantlebury, R.A., and Wilkinson, P.T.\n\n### Abstract Interpretation\n\n- Making a sound approximation of the semantics of a program.\n- Identifying that all execution traces of the program are within bounds.\n- If a property is true on the approximation, it is true for the program.\n- Tool support scales up: e.g., 1,000,000 lines of C (Airbus).\n\n### Inspection\n\n- Techniques aimed at systematically verifying software artifacts to find as many defects as possible, as early as possible.\n- Performed by a group of team workers.\n- Works on source code but not only: any software artifact (e.g., requirements, diagrams, tests).\n\n## Fault Handling and Testing\n\n### Fault Handling\n\n- **Fault Tolerance**: Ensuring the system continues to operate correctly even when faults occur.\n- **Fault Detection**: Identifying faults in the system.\n- **Debugging**: Locating and fixing faults.\n- **Testing**: Part of fault detection and debugging.\n\n### Cost of Testing\n\n- Testing represents a substantial percentage of software development costs and time to market.\n- Restricting early testing usually increases costs.\n- Industry ratio Test-LOC / App-LOC can be 2, 3, 4; open source ratio App-LOC / Test-LOC can be 2, 3, … 7.\n\n## Software Bugs and Their Impact\n\n### Economic Impact\n\n- National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) study:\n  - Estimated annual cost due to inadequate software testing: $5.85 billion.\n  - Projected cost to the entire U.S. economy: $59.5 billion.\n- Consortium for Information and Software Quality:\n  - Poor software quality in the USA = $2 trillions in 2020.\n\n### Anecdotal Evidence\n\n- Bug in telecom: 8-digit dollar cost in compensation.\n- Debugging Fault: $100,000 for one!\n- Examples of costly bugs:\n  - A 104 years old woman received an invitation to a kindergarten (1992).\n  - Underground train in London left a station without the driver (1990).\n  - Failure in an automated luggage system in an airport (1995).\n  - NASA mission to Mars: Incorrect conversion from imperial to metric led to loss of Mars satellite (1999).\n  - Ariane 5 Flight 501: The space rocket was destroyed (1996).\n  - Therac-25: Radiation therapy and X-ray machine killed several patients (1985-1987).\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- **Verification vs Validation**:\n  - Verification ensures the system is built correctly, while validation ensures the right system is built.\n- **Testing Goals**:\n  - To demonstrate software dependability and show the presence of bugs, though not their absence.\n- **V&V Techniques**:\n  - Dynamic techniques include testing and symbolic execution.\n  - Static techniques include program slicing, model checking, abstract interpretation, and inspection.\n- **Cost and Impact**:\n  - Testing is a significant part of software development costs and time to market.\n  - Inadequate testing has substantial economic impacts.\n\n## Summary\n\nSoftware verification, validation, and testing are crucial activities in software development aimed at ensuring the quality and reliability of software systems. Understanding the differences between verification and validation, as well as the various techniques involved in these processes, is essential for effective software engineering. The economic impact of inadequate testing highlights the importance of integrating rigorous testing strategies into the development lifecycle.",
