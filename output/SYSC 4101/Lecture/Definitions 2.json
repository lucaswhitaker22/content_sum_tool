        "overview": "This lecture focuses on test model criteria, a crucial aspect of software testing. It delves into the concept of exhaustive testing and explores techniques to reduce the number of test cases. The lecture then introduces two primary testing approaches: functional testing, which checks conformance with specifications, and structural testing, which examines the control flow and data flow of the system. It emphasizes the importance of selecting appropriate test criteria based on the testing objectives and the model being tested. The lecture also discusses the theoretical hierarchy of criteria, highlighting the subsumption relation between criteria and its implications for test suite adequacy. Finally, it explores two ways to utilize test criteria: generating test cases to satisfy the criterion and evaluating the coverage achieved by externally generated test cases. The lecture concludes by addressing the challenges associated with creating generators and recognizers for test criteria and presents Marick's recommendation for a practical approach to testing.",

    "notes": "# SYSC 4101 / SYSC 5105: Definitions—Part II\n\n## Exhaustive Testing\n### Definition\n- **Exhaustive testing** involves testing a program with all possible inputs.\n  - This approach is most of the time impossible due to the vast number of potential inputs.\n\n### Examples\n- **Factorial Function**: Testing a program that computes the factorial function (`n = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1`) would require running the program with all possible integer values, which is impractical.\n- **Compiler**: Exhaustive testing for a compiler, such as `javac`, would involve compiling every possible Java program, which is clearly infeasible.\n\n### Reducing Test Cases\n- To manage the number of inputs, testing criteria are used to group input elements into **equivalence classes**.\n  - One input is selected from each class.\n  - Criteria help decide which test inputs to use and when to stop testing.\n\n## Test Data Selection Procedure\n\n### Software Representation\n- The test model can represent either the **specification** (Functional Testing) or the **implementation** (Structural Testing).\n\n#### Functional Testing\n- Focuses on checking conformance with the specification.\n  - **Example**: Testing a vending machine based on its functional requirements.\n\n#### Structural Testing\n- Focuses on the internal structure of the software.\n  - **Example**: Testing based on the control flow graph of a function.\n\n### Steps in Test Data Selection\n\n1. **Choose a Test Model**\n   - Select a model that represents either the specification or the implementation.\n\n2. **Select a Test Criterion**\n   - Choose a criterion associated with the test model (e.g., all-statements, all-transitions).\n\n3. **Identify Test Objectives**\n   - Determine what needs to be exercised in the model (e.g., transitions, statements).\n\n4. **Create Test Case Specifications**\n   - Define specific test cases that meet the test objectives.\n\n5. **Identify Test Data/Input**\n   - Determine the input values needed to execute each test case.\n\n6. **Identify Oracle**\n   - Define what is expected during and after the execution of each test case.\n\n## Functional vs. Structural Testing\n\n### Functional Testing\n- **Pros**:\n  - Checks conformance with the specification.\n  - Scales up to different granularity levels (function, class, package, system).\n- **Cons**:\n  - Depends on the detail of the specification.\n  - Does not reveal how much of the system code is being tested.\n  - Cannot detect unexpected functionalities.\n\n### Structural Testing\n- **Pros**:\n  - Based on control and data flow criteria.\n  - Allows confidence in how much of the system is being tested.\n- **Cons**:\n  - Does not scale up well beyond unit and integration testing levels.\n  - Cannot reveal missing functionalities.\n  - Does not work for packages/components or systems.\n\n## Test Model Criterion\n\n### Coverage Ratio\n- Given a criterion `C` for a model `M`, the coverage ratio of a test set `T` is the proportion of elements in `M` defined by `C` that are covered by `T`.\n- A test set `T` is **C-adequate** when the coverage ratio achieves 100% for criterion `C`.\n\n### Examples\n- **Control Flow Graph**: A test suite exercises 5 out of 8 statements, achieving 62.5% coverage.\n  - The test suite is not adequate for the all-statements criterion.\n- **Use Case Scenarios**: A test suite exercises all 12 scenarios, achieving 100% coverage.\n  - The test suite is adequate for the all-scenarios criterion.\n\n## Revised Notion of Adequacy\n- When not all test requirements are feasible, the coverage ratio is calculated based on feasible elements.\n- A test set `T` is **C-adequate** when it covers 100% of the feasible elements defined by `C`.\n\n## Theoretical Hierarchy of Criteria\n\n### Subsumption Relation\n- For a given model `M`, criterion `C1` subsumes `C2` if any `C1`-adequate test set is also `C2`-adequate.\n  - **Example**: For finite state machines, the all-paths criterion subsumes the all-transitions criterion.\n\n### Implications\n- Satisfying `C1` tends to be more expensive than satisfying `C2`.\n- A `C1`-adequate test suite tends to detect more faults than a `C2`-adequate test suite.\n\n## Using Test Criteria\n\n### Two Ways to Use Test Criteria\n1. **Generate Test Values/Test Cases**\n   - Use a criterion as a selection criterion to generate values that satisfy the criterion.\n   - Need a generator tool or human to create these values.\n2. **Evaluate Coverage**\n   - Use a criterion as a coverage criterion to evaluate the coverage achieved by externally generated test values/test cases.\n   - Need a recognizer tool or human to decide whether a set of values satisfies a criterion.\n\n### Problems and Issues\n- Creating generators and recognizers is often undecidable for most criteria.\n- However, it is generally easier to build recognizers than generators.\n- Coverage analysis tools (recognizers) are more plentiful.\n\n## Misuse of Terminology\n- Beware of misusing terms like “coverage”:\n  - **Example**: Using the all-statements criterion in a recognizer context instead of a generator context.\n\n## Using a Test Selection Criterion\n\n### Steps\n1. **Choose a Test Model**\n2. **Select a Test Criterion**\n3. **Identify Test Objectives**\n4. **Create Test Case Specifications**\n5. **Identify Test Data/Input**\n6. **Identify Oracle**\n\n### Example\n- **State Machine**:\n  - Choose a state machine as the test model.\n  - Select the all-transitions criterion.\n  - Identify transitions as test objectives.\n  - Create test case specifications to exercise these transitions.\n  - Identify input values to execute each test case.\n  - Define what to check during and after execution (oracle).\n\n## Marick’s Recommendation\n\n### Approach\n1. **Generate Functional Tests**\n   - Generate tests from requirements and design to try every function using a functional selection criterion.\n2. **Check Structural Coverage**\n   - Check the structural coverage after functional tests are verified.\n3. **Generate Additional Functional Tests**\n   - Generate functional tests to induce additional coverage where structural coverage is imperfect.\n\n## Test Criteria Based on Structure [Offutt]\n\n### Types of Test Criteria\n- **Graphs**: State machines, control flow graphs.\n- **Logical Expressions**: Conditional statements, loops.\n- **Input Domain Characterization**: Describes the input domain of the software under test.\n- **Syntactic Structures**: Based on grammar or other syntactic definitions (e.g., mutation testing).\n\n### Examples\n- **State Machine**: Testing transitions in a vending machine.\n- **Logical Expressions**: Testing conditional statements in a compiler.\n- **Input Domain Characterization**: Testing input ranges for a method.\n- **Syntactic Structures**: Mutation testing based on syntactic rules.\n\n## Case Studies\n\n### Vending Machine\n- **Specification**: Gets 5p or 10p coins, sells 15p cans.\n- **Test Model**: State machine representing the vending machine's states.\n- **Test Criterion**: All-transitions.\n- **Test Case Specifications**: Define sequences of transitions to test.\n- **Test Data/Input**: Input values (coins) to execute each test case.\n- **Oracle**: Expected outcomes (cans dispensed or not).\n\n### ATM System\n- **Feature**: Transfer feature in an ATM system deployed as a Web service.\n- **Test Model**: Use case scenarios or state machines representing the transfer process.\n- **Test Criterion**: All-scenarios or all-transitions.\n- **Test Case Specifications**: Define test cases to exercise these scenarios or transitions.\n- **Test Data/Input**: Input values (user credentials, amounts) to execute each test case.\n- **Oracle**: Expected outcomes (successful transfers, error messages).\n\n### TCAS System\n- **Feature**: Collision avoidance system for aircraft.\n- **Test Model**: State machines or control flow graphs representing the system's logic.\n- **Test Criterion**: All-paths or all-transitions.\n- **Test Case Specifications**: Define test cases to exercise these paths or transitions.\n- **Test Data/Input**: Input values (aircraft positions, velocities) to execute each test case.\n- **Oracle**: Expected outcomes (alerts, advisories).\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- **Exhaustive Testing is Impractical**: It is generally impossible to test all possible inputs.\n- **Equivalence Classes**: Group inputs into equivalence classes to reduce the number of test cases.\n- **Functional vs. Structural Testing**: Functional testing checks conformance with specifications, while structural testing checks the internal structure of the software.\n- **Test Criteria**: Use criteria to select and evaluate test cases; ensure clear understanding of generator and recognizer contexts.\n- **Marick’s Recommendation**: Combine functional and structural testing approaches for comprehensive coverage.\n- **Case Studies**: Apply test criteria and models to real-world systems like vending machines, ATM systems, and TCAS systems.",
