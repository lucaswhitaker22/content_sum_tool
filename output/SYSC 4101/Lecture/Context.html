            <h1>SYSC 4101 / SYSC 5105: Software Verification and Validation</h1>
<h2>Context</h2>
<h3>Validation, Verification, and Testing</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Validation</strong>: The process of ensuring that the software meets the user's needs and requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Verification</strong>: The process of ensuring that the software is built correctly, adhering to its specifications and design.</li>
<li><strong>Testing</strong>: A subset of verification, involving the execution of the software with specific inputs to check its behavior.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why Do We Test?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demonstrate Dependability</strong>: Testing aims to show that the software can be depended upon, though it cannot prove the absence of bugs.</li>
<li><strong>Identify Faults</strong>: Testing helps in identifying bugs and defects in the software.</li>
<li><strong>Gain Confidence</strong>: Despite incomplete testing, it helps in gaining confidence that the system behaves as desired under various conditions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Definitions (Verification vs. Validation)</h2>
<h3>IEEE Definitions</h3>
<h4>Software Verification</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>IEEE Definition (Std 610.12.1990)</strong>: The process of evaluating a system or component to determine whether the products of a given development phase satisfy the conditions imposed at the start of that phase.</li>
<li><strong>Focus</strong>: Internal consistency, correctness, compliance.</li>
<li><strong>Methods</strong>: Reviews, inspections, walkthroughs, static analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Code Execution</strong>: Does not involve executing the code.</li>
<li><strong>Goal</strong>: Ensure the system matches design specifications.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Software Validation</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>IEEE Definition (Std 610.12.1990)</strong>: The process of evaluating a system or component during or at the end of the development process to determine whether it satisfies specified requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Focus</strong>: Meeting user needs and intended use.</li>
<li><strong>Methods</strong>: Unit testing, integration testing, system testing, user acceptance testing (UAT).</li>
<li><strong>Code Execution</strong>: Involves running the code.</li>
<li><strong>Goal</strong>: Ensure the system performs as expected by users.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Waterfall Model and Verification/Validation</h2>
<h3>Phases of Waterfall Model</h3>
<h4>Requirements</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stated Objective</strong>: Requirements should not contradict each other.</li>
<li><strong>Verification</strong>: Ensure requirements are consistent.</li>
<li><strong>Validation</strong>: Validate that requirements are correctly designed.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Design</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stated Objective</strong>: Different UML diagrams should be consistent.</li>
<li><strong>Verification</strong>: Ensure diagrams are consistent.</li>
<li><strong>Validation</strong>: Validate that the design meets the requirements.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Implementation</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stated Objective</strong>: Design implemented with as few faults as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Verification</strong>: Execute test cases to ensure the implementation matches the design.</li>
<li><strong>Validation</strong>: Validate that the implementation meets the user's needs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Verification and Validation Techniques</h2>
<h3>Dynamic Techniques</h3>
<h4>Verification Testing (or simply, Testing)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>: Inputs supplied to the system are valued (values instead of symbols).</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Unit testing, integration testing, system testing.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Symbolic Execution</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>: Inputs supplied to the system are symbolic (symbols, not values).</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>:
  <code>c
  void foo(int x, int y) {
      int t;
      if(x &gt; y)
          t = x + 1;
      else
          t = y;
      if(t &lt;= x)
          // do something
  }</code></li>
<li>Replace <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>t</code> with symbols <code>α</code>, <code>β</code>, <code>γ</code>.</li>
<li>Analyze path conditions to determine if certain paths are satisfiable.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Static Techniques</h3>
<h4>Program Slicing</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>: Given a variable and its location, build an executable subprogram by identifying and discarding irrelevant statements.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>:
  <code>pascal
  begin
      read(x, y);
      total := 0.0;
      sum := 0.0;
      if x &lt;= 1 then
          sum := y;
      else begin
          read(z);
          total := x * y;
      end;
      write(total, sum);
  end;</code></li>
<li>Slice on the value of <code>z</code> at statement 12.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Model Checking</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>: Verifying properties of the system using models (e.g., finite state machines, Petri nets).</li>
<li><strong>Examples</strong>:</li>
<li>Verify that a state is always reachable or never reachable.</li>
<li>Verify there is no deadlock.</li>
<li>Verify a program necessarily terminates.</li>
<li>Example: Alternating-bit protocol.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Abstract Interpretation</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>: Making a sound approximation of the semantics of a program to identify properties such as out-of-bounds counters or division by zero.</li>
<li><strong>Tool Support</strong>: Scales up to large codebases (e.g., Airbus).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Inspection</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>: Systematically verifying software artifacts to find defects early.</li>
<li><strong>Methods</strong>: Performed by a group of team workers; works on source code and other artifacts like requirements and diagrams.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fault Handling and Testing</h2>
<h3>Fault Handling</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fault Tolerance</strong>: Designing systems to continue operating despite faults.</li>
<li><strong>Fault Detection</strong>: Identifying faults through testing and other methods.</li>
<li><strong>Debugging</strong>: Correcting faults found during testing.</li>
<li><strong>Testing Types</strong>:</li>
<li>Component Testing</li>
<li>Integration Testing</li>
<li>System Testing</li>
</ul>
<h2>Goal of Testing</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demonstrate Dependability</strong>: Show that the software can be depended upon, though it cannot prove the absence of bugs.</li>
<li><strong>No Absolute Certainty</strong>: Testing is finite and cannot cover all possible scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Integration with Other Activities</strong>: Testing should be integrated with other verification activities.</li>
<li><strong>Context-Dependent Sufficiency</strong>: What is considered “sufficient” dependability varies by context (e.g., phone app vs. aircraft autopilot).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Remarks on Testing</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inevitability of Faults</strong>: Despite rigorous testing, software will still have faults.</li>
<li><strong>Cost and Time</strong>: Testing represents a substantial percentage of development costs and time to market.</li>
<li><strong>Complexity</strong>: Testing large systems is complex and requires strategy and technology.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cost of Testing</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Development Budget</strong>: About half of the development budget is spent on testing.</li>
<li><strong>Post-Design Activity</strong>: Testing is the main post-design activity in real-world usage.</li>
<li><strong>Early Testing Importance</strong>: Restricting early testing increases costs later on.</li>
<li><strong>Test Code Ratio</strong>: Industry ratio for test lines of code to application lines of code can be 2:1, 3:1, or more.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Software Bugs and Their Costs</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic Impact</strong>: Studies by NIST estimate annual costs due to inadequate software testing at $5.85 billion in specific sectors, projecting to $59.5 billion for the entire U.S. economy.</li>
<li><strong>Anecdotal Evidence</strong>:</li>
<li>Telecom bug: 8-digit dollar cost in compensation.</li>
<li>Debugging fault: $100,000 for one instance.</li>
<li>Consortium for Information and Software Quality: Poor software quality in the USA = $2 trillions in 2020.</li>
<li><strong>Historical Examples</strong>:</li>
<li>Year 2000 bug affecting a 104-year-old woman's kindergarten invitation.</li>
<li>Underground train incident in London due to interface misuse.</li>
<li>Failure in an automated luggage system at an airport.</li>
<li>NASA Mars satellite loss due to unit conversion error.</li>
<li>Ariane 5 Flight 501 destruction.</li>
<li>Therac-25 radiation therapy machine incidents.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Key Takeaway:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Verification</strong> ensures that the software is built correctly according to its specifications.</li>
<li><strong>Validation</strong> ensures that the software meets the user's needs and requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Testing</strong> is a critical part of verification but cannot guarantee the absence of bugs; it must be integrated with other verification activities to ensure dependability.</li>
</ul>
