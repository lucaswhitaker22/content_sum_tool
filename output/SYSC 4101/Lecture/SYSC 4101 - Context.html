            <h1>SYSC4101 / SYSC5105: Software Validation, Verification, and Testing</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p>Software validation, verification, and testing are crucial activities in the software development lifecycle. These processes ensure that the software system meets the specified requirements and performs as expected by users.</p>
<h3>Definitions</h3>
<h4>Software Verification</h4>
<p><strong>IEEE Definition (Std 610.12.1990):</strong>
- <strong>Process of evaluating a system or component to determine whether the products of a given development phase satisfy the conditions imposed at the start of that phase.</strong>
- <strong>Checking whether the system adheres to properties termed as verification properties.</strong>
- <strong>Constructing the system well.</strong></p>
<h4>Software Validation</h4>
<p><strong>IEEE Definition (Std 610.12.1990):</strong>
- <strong>The process of evaluating a system or component during or at the end of the development process to determine whether it satisfies specified requirements.</strong>
- <strong>Relationship with other software engineering activities (e.g., Requirements elicitation, Analysis).</strong>
- <strong>Constructing the right system.</strong></p>
<h2>Verification vs. Validation</h2>
<h3>Purpose and Focus</h3>
<p>| Aspect | Verification | Validation |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| Purpose | Ensure the product is built correctly. | Ensure the right product is built. |
| Focus   | Internal consistency, correctness, compliance. | Meeting user needs and intended use. |
| Testing Type | Static Testing (Reviews, inspections, walkthroughs, static analysis) | Dynamic Testing (Unit testing, integration testing, system testing, user acceptance testing (UAT)) |
| Code Execution | Does not involve executing the code. | Involves running the code. |
| Goal      | Ensure the system matches design specifications. | Ensure the system performs as expected by users. |</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Verification:</strong> Code reviews, requirement reviews, design analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Validation:</strong> Code reviews, requirement reviews, design analysis.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Verification and Validation Techniques</h2>
<h3>Dynamic Techniques</h3>
<h4>Verification Testing (or simply, Testing)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inputs supplied to the system are valued (values instead of symbols).</strong></li>
<li><strong>The most used V&amp;V technique.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4>Symbolic Execution</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inputs supplied to the system are symbolic (symbols, not values).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Visualizing what is accomplished by a sequence of (assignment) statements.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Compute an input/output function: any value of variable x in a procedure is a function f(a,b,c) of procedure parameters a, b and c. Symbolic execution computes f().</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example Program:</strong>
1. <code>read(x,y);</code>
2. <code>z := x+y;</code>
3. <code>x := x-y;</code>
4. <code>z := x*z;</code>
5. <code>write(z);</code></p>
<p><strong>Execution with Values:</strong>
- With <code>x=2</code> and <code>y=4</code>, <code>z = -12</code>.
- With <code>x=α</code> and <code>y=β</code>, <code>z = α*α-β*β</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Symbolic Execution Example:</strong>
<code>python
void foo(int x, int y) {
    int t;
    if(x&gt;y)
        t=x+1;
    else
        t=y;
    if(t&lt;=x)
        // do something
}</code>
- Replace <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>t</code> with symbols <code>α</code>, <code>β</code>, <code>γ</code>, respectively.
- After line 6:
  - <code>α&gt;β =&gt; γ=α+1</code>
  - <code>α≤β =&gt; γ=β</code>
- Line 8 executes (path condition) if:
  ① <code>α&gt;β =&gt; γ=α+1 ∧ γ≤α</code>
  or
  ② <code>α≤β =&gt; γ=β ∧ γ≤α</code>
- Are expressions satisfiable?
  ① <code>α+1≤α</code> is not satisfiable.
  ② <code>α≤β ∧ β≤α</code> is satisfiable: <code>α=β</code>.</p>
<h3>Static Techniques</h3>
<h4>Program Slicing</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Given a variable and its location in the control flow of the program, build an executable subprogram from the original program by identifying and discarding the statements irrelevant to the computation of the value to be assumed by that variable at that point.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example Program:</strong>
<code>python
begin
    read(x,y);
    total := 0.0;
    sum := 0.0;
    if x&lt;=1 then sum := y else begin read(z); total := x*y end;
    write(total,sum);
end;</code>
- Slice on the value of <code>z</code> at statement 12:
  <code>python
  begin
      read(x,y);
      if x&lt;=1 then sum := y else begin read(z); total := x*y end;
      write(total,sum);
  end;</code>
- Slice on the value of <code>x</code> at statement 9:
  <code>python
  begin
      read(x,y);
      total := x*y;
      write(total,sum);
  end;</code></p>
<h4>Model Checking</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Verifying properties of the system using models (e.g., finite state machines, petri nets).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Exhaustively and automatically check whether a model meets a given specification.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>
- Verify that a state is always reachable (liveness property) or, on the contrary, never reachable.
- Verify there is no deadlock.
- Verify a program necessarily terminates.</p>
<p><strong>Aside Note: Petri Nets</strong>
Petri nets are a powerful tool for modeling concurrent systems and verifying their properties.</p>
<h4>Abstract Interpretation</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>With abstract interpretation, we make a sound approximation of the semantics of a program.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Identify that all execution traces of the program are within bounds.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example Properties:</strong>
- Out of bounds counters (e.g., in loops), Division by zero, …</p>
<p><strong>Tool Support:</strong>
- Tool support scales up: 1,000,000 lines of C (Airbus) ! 
  - C++, Java, Ada support too.</p>
<h4>Inspection</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Techniques aimed at systematically verifying software artifacts with the intent of finding as many defects as possible, as early as possible.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Performed by a group of team workers.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Faults often become more obvious to team members others than the original author.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Works on source code but not only: any software artifact (e.g., requirements, diagrams, tests).</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Goal of Testing</h2>
<h3>Main Goal</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The main goal of testing is to demonstrate that the software can be depended upon, i.e., sufficient dependability.</strong></li>
<li><strong>No absolute certainty can be gained from testing because testing is necessarily finite.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Integration with Other Verification Activities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Testing should be integrated with other verification activities (e.g., static and dynamic V&amp;V techniques).</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Remarks</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>No matter how rigorous we are, software is going to be faulty.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Testing represents a substantial percentage of software development costs and time to market.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Impossible to test under all operating conditions – based on incomplete testing, we must gain confidence that the system has the desired behavior.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Cost of Testing</h2>
<h3>Development Budget</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>You are going to spend about half of your development budget on testing, whether you want to or not.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Real-World Usage</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>In real-world usage, testing is the main post-design activity.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Restricting early testing usually increases costs.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Industry Ratios</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>In some organizations there are more lines of test code than application code !!!</strong></li>
<li>Rule of thumb: one line of application code =&gt; two lines of test code.</li>
<li>Industry ratio Test-LOC / App-LOC can be 2, 3, 4.</li>
<li>Open source (reverse) ratio App-LOC / Test-LOC can be 2, 3 … 7.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Software Bugs - Cost</h2>
<h3>National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Studies in the manufacturing and transportation equipment sectors to assess the cost to the U.S. economy of inadequate software testing infrastructure.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Results (annual cost):</strong></li>
<li>Estimation: $5.85 billion.</li>
<li>Projection to the entire U.S. economy: $59.5 billion.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Anecdotal Evidence</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bug in telecom: 8-digit dollar cost in compensation.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Debugging Fault: $100,000 for one</strong></li>
<li><strong>Consortium for Information and Software Quality</strong></li>
<li>Poor software quality in the USA = $2 trillions in 2020.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Examples of Software Bugs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>A 104 years old woman received an invitation to a kindergarten (1992).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Interface misuse: Underground train in London left a station without the driver (1990).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Over budget project: Failure in an automated luggage system in an airport (1995).</strong></li>
<li><strong>NASA mission to Mars: Incorrect conversion from imperial to metric leads to loss of Mars satellite (1999).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ariane 5 Flight 501: The space rocket was destroyed (1996).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Therac-25: Radiation therapy and X-ray machine killed several patients (1985-1987).</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Key Takeaway:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Software validation, verification, and testing are essential for ensuring that software systems meet specified requirements and perform as expected by users.</strong></li>
<li><strong>While no absolute certainty can be gained from testing, integrating various verification activities and using appropriate techniques like symbolic execution, model checking, and abstract interpretation can significantly enhance the reliability of software systems.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>By understanding these concepts and techniques, developers can better manage the complexities of software development and ensure that their products are reliable and meet user needs effectively.</p>
