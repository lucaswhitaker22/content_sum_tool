    "notes": "# SYSC 4101 / SYSC 5105: Software Verification and Validation\n\n## Context\n\n### Validation, Verification, and Testing\n\n- **Validation**: The process of ensuring that the software meets the user's needs and requirements.\n- **Verification**: The process of ensuring that the software is built correctly, adhering to its specifications and design.\n- **Testing**: A subset of verification, involving the execution of the software with specific inputs to check its behavior.\n\n### Why Do We Test?\n\n- **Demonstrate Dependability**: Testing aims to show that the software can be depended upon, though it cannot prove the absence of bugs.\n- **Identify Faults**: Testing helps in identifying bugs and defects in the software.\n- **Gain Confidence**: Despite incomplete testing, it helps in gaining confidence that the system behaves as desired under various conditions.\n\n## Definitions (Verification vs. Validation)\n\n### IEEE Definitions\n\n#### Software Verification\n- **IEEE Definition (Std 610.12.1990)**: The process of evaluating a system or component to determine whether the products of a given development phase satisfy the conditions imposed at the start of that phase.\n- **Focus**: Internal consistency, correctness, compliance.\n- **Methods**: Reviews, inspections, walkthroughs, static analysis.\n- **Code Execution**: Does not involve executing the code.\n- **Goal**: Ensure the system matches design specifications.\n\n#### Software Validation\n- **IEEE Definition (Std 610.12.1990)**: The process of evaluating a system or component during or at the end of the development process to determine whether it satisfies specified requirements.\n- **Focus**: Meeting user needs and intended use.\n- **Methods**: Unit testing, integration testing, system testing, user acceptance testing (UAT).\n- **Code Execution**: Involves running the code.\n- **Goal**: Ensure the system performs as expected by users.\n\n## Waterfall Model and Verification/Validation\n\n### Phases of Waterfall Model\n\n#### Requirements\n- **Stated Objective**: Requirements should not contradict each other.\n- **Verification**: Ensure requirements are consistent.\n- **Validation**: Validate that requirements are correctly designed.\n\n#### Design\n- **Stated Objective**: Different UML diagrams should be consistent.\n- **Verification**: Ensure diagrams are consistent.\n- **Validation**: Validate that the design meets the requirements.\n\n#### Implementation\n- **Stated Objective**: Design implemented with as few faults as possible.\n- **Verification**: Execute test cases to ensure the implementation matches the design.\n- **Validation**: Validate that the implementation meets the user's needs.\n\n## Verification and Validation Techniques\n\n### Dynamic Techniques\n\n#### Verification Testing (or simply, Testing)\n- **Definition**: Inputs supplied to the system are valued (values instead of symbols).\n- **Example**: Unit testing, integration testing, system testing.\n\n#### Symbolic Execution\n- **Definition**: Inputs supplied to the system are symbolic (symbols, not values).\n- **Example**:\n  ```c\n  void foo(int x, int y) {\n      int t;\n      if(x > y)\n          t = x + 1;\n      else\n          t = y;\n      if(t <= x)\n          // do something\n  }\n  ```\n  - Replace `x`, `y`, `t` with symbols `α`, `β`, `γ`.\n  - Analyze path conditions to determine if certain paths are satisfiable.\n\n### Static Techniques\n\n#### Program Slicing\n- **Definition**: Given a variable and its location, build an executable subprogram by identifying and discarding irrelevant statements.\n- **Example**:\n  ```pascal\n  begin\n      read(x, y);\n      total := 0.0;\n      sum := 0.0;\n      if x <= 1 then\n          sum := y;\n      else begin\n          read(z);\n          total := x * y;\n      end;\n      write(total, sum);\n  end;\n  ```\n  - Slice on the value of `z` at statement 12.\n\n#### Model Checking\n- **Definition**: Verifying properties of the system using models (e.g., finite state machines, Petri nets).\n- **Examples**:\n  - Verify that a state is always reachable or never reachable.\n  - Verify there is no deadlock.\n  - Verify a program necessarily terminates.\n  - Example: Alternating-bit protocol.\n\n#### Abstract Interpretation\n- **Definition**: Making a sound approximation of the semantics of a program to identify properties such as out-of-bounds counters or division by zero.\n- **Tool Support**: Scales up to large codebases (e.g., Airbus).\n\n#### Inspection\n- **Definition**: Systematically verifying software artifacts to find defects early.\n- **Methods**: Performed by a group of team workers; works on source code and other artifacts like requirements and diagrams.\n\n## Fault Handling and Testing\n\n### Fault Handling\n\n- **Fault Tolerance**: Designing systems to continue operating despite faults.\n- **Fault Detection**: Identifying faults through testing and other methods.\n- **Debugging**: Correcting faults found during testing.\n- **Testing Types**:\n  - Component Testing\n  - Integration Testing\n  - System Testing\n\n## Goal of Testing\n\n- **Demonstrate Dependability**: Show that the software can be depended upon, though it cannot prove the absence of bugs.\n- **No Absolute Certainty**: Testing is finite and cannot cover all possible scenarios.\n- **Integration with Other Activities**: Testing should be integrated with other verification activities.\n- **Context-Dependent Sufficiency**: What is considered “sufficient” dependability varies by context (e.g., phone app vs. aircraft autopilot).\n\n## Remarks on Testing\n\n- **Inevitability of Faults**: Despite rigorous testing, software will still have faults.\n- **Cost and Time**: Testing represents a substantial percentage of development costs and time to market.\n- **Complexity**: Testing large systems is complex and requires strategy and technology.\n\n## Cost of Testing\n\n- **Development Budget**: About half of the development budget is spent on testing.\n- **Post-Design Activity**: Testing is the main post-design activity in real-world usage.\n- **Early Testing Importance**: Restricting early testing increases costs later on.\n- **Test Code Ratio**: Industry ratio for test lines of code to application lines of code can be 2:1, 3:1, or more.\n\n## Software Bugs and Their Costs\n\n- **Economic Impact**: Studies by NIST estimate annual costs due to inadequate software testing at $5.85 billion in specific sectors, projecting to $59.5 billion for the entire U.S. economy.\n- **Anecdotal Evidence**:\n  - Telecom bug: 8-digit dollar cost in compensation.\n  - Debugging fault: $100,000 for one instance.\n  - Consortium for Information and Software Quality: Poor software quality in the USA = $2 trillions in 2020.\n- **Historical Examples**:\n  - Year 2000 bug affecting a 104-year-old woman's kindergarten invitation.\n  - Underground train incident in London due to interface misuse.\n  - Failure in an automated luggage system at an airport.\n  - NASA Mars satellite loss due to unit conversion error.\n  - Ariane 5 Flight 501 destruction.\n  - Therac-25 radiation therapy machine incidents.\n\n### Key Takeaway:\n\n- **Verification** ensures that the software is built correctly according to its specifications.\n- **Validation** ensures that the software meets the user's needs and requirements.\n- **Testing** is a critical part of verification but cannot guarantee the absence of bugs; it must be integrated with other verification activities to ensure dependability.",
